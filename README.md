# OpenGL_UserControlled_3DShapes
OpenGL program written in C++ that demonstrates a live demo of two 3D shapes and one 2D shape constantly moving. The user will have control to move each shape in every direction (x ,y, and z plane). The user will also have the ability to change the color scheme of the program, or stop their animation with a mouse click.
